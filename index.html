            <p>Hello, I am a undergraduate student in Mechatronic Systems Engineering at Turkish-German University. I completed my compulsory workshop internship at İkitelli Topkapı Schools, and my professional internship at Magma Otomat Company's R&D department. During this process, I participated in various projects using programming languages and tools such as Solidworks, Python, Java, PyQt, and image processing.
            Additionally, I developed different projects using design tools such as Solidworks and AutoCAD for school projects. I also worked on projects within the school using Arduino and Raspberry Pi. I am currently working on my thesis on image processing methods and mechanisms used in Recycling Machines. I aim to pursue a career in this field.Furthermore, I would like to state that I want to improve myself in the software field, and I am particularly interested in working in areas such as web and mobile applications. Therefore, I have shown a special interest in PyQt, web technologies, and mobile application development in both school projects and internships. I continue to develop myself in these areas and always look for new learning opportunities to specialize in them.
            All of these experiences will help me to be successful in my future career and personal development. I want to utilize my software experience in web and mobile applications and shape my career accordingly.</p>
